            <h5>PREPARE THE HOT COCOA</h5>
    
            <li>
                In a medium saucepan, combine evaporated milk, regular milk, 
                and heavy cream over medium heat.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in brown sugar, cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt until 
                smooth and warmed through. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add semi-sweet chocolate and whisk until fully melted. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in vanilla extract, adjust sweetness as desired, and keep
                warm on low heat.   
            </li>
        
            <h5>MAKE MARSHMALLOW FLUFF</h5>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, add egg whites and cream of tartar. Whisk
                until the mixture becomes bubbly and foamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                in a saucepan, combine water, sugar, and corn syrup. Heat over 
                medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves 
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow the mixture to simmer without stirring further, until
                it reaches about 240°F or 115°C using a candy thermometer.
            </li>
            <li>
                With the mixer running at medium speed, slowly stream the hot
                syrup into the egg whites. Avoid pouring too quickly to prevent 
                scrambling 
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all the syrup is added, increase the mixer speed to

            </li>

            <li>
                Pour the prepared hot cocoa into cups or mugs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the marshmallow topping to a piping bag fitted with
                a star or round tip.   
            </li>
            <li>
                Pipe the marshmallow around the rim of each cup.   
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a kitchen torch to toast the marshmallow until golden brown.

            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, 
                and salt until well combined.   
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the
                eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract.    
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually whisk in the cold milk, starting with 1 1/4 cups and
                adding more if needed, until the batter is smooth and has the 
                consistency of heavy cream.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly

            </li>
            <li>
                Pour about 1/4 cup of batter into the center of the pan, then 
                quickly swirl the pan to spread the batter into a thin, 
                even layer.

                Cook for about 1-2 minutes, or until the edges start to lift
