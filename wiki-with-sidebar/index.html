                        The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct 
                        colorpoint coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large
                        and weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat.
                        American breeder Ann Baker developed Ragdolls in the 
                        1960s. They are best known for their docile, placid 
                        temperament and affectionate nature. The name Ragdoll 
                        is derived from the tendency of individuals from the 
                        original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when 
                        picked up.The breed is particularly popular in both 
                        the United Kingdom and the United States.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ragdolls are often known as "dog-like cats" or 
                        "puppy-like cats", due to their tendency to follow 
                        people around, their receptiveness to handling, and 
                        their relative lack of aggression towards other pets.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ragdolls are distinguishable by their pointed 
                        coloration (where the body is lighter than the face, 
                        ears, legs, and tail), large round blue eyes, soft, 
                        thick coats, thick limbs, long tails, and soft bodies. 
                        Their color rings are commonly tricolor or bicolor.

                    <h2>Orgin</h2>
                    <p>
                        The breed was developed in Riverside, California, by 
                        breeder Ann Baker. In 1963, a regular, non-pedigreed, 
                        white domestic longhaired cat named Josephine produced 
                        several litters of typical cats. Josephine was not 
                        of any particular breed, nor were the males who sired 
                        the original litters. Ann Baker herself said that the 
                        original cats of the Ragdoll breed were "alley cats". 
                        Josephine later produced kittens with a docile, placid 
                        temperament, affectionate nature, and a tendency to go 
                        limp and relaxed when picked up. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Out of those early litters came Blackie, an all-black 
                        male, and Daddy Warbucks, a seal point with white feet. 
                        Daddy Warbucks sired the founding bi-color female 
                        Fugianna, and Blackie sired Buckwheat, a dark 
                        brown-black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna and 
                        Buckwheat were Josephine's daughters. All Ragdolls are
                        descended from Baker's cats through matings of Daddy 
                        Warbucks to Fugianna and Buckwheat
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Baker, in an unusual move, spurned traditional cat 
                        breeding associations. She trademarked the name Ragdoll,
                        set up her own registry—the International Ragdoll Cat
                        Association (IRCA)—around 1971, and enforced stringent 
                        standards on anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats 
                        under that name. The Ragdolls were also not allowed 
                        to be registered by other breed associations. 
                        The IRCA is still in existence today but is quite small,
                        particularly since Baker's death in 1997.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1975, a group led by a husband-and-wife team, Denny 
                        and Laura Dayton, broke ranks with the IRCA to gain 
                        mainstream recognition for the Ragdoll. Beginning with 
                        a breeding pair of IRCA cats, this group eventually 
                        developed the Ragdoll standard currently accepted by 
                        major cat registries such as the CFA and the FIFe. 
                        Around the time of the spread of the Ragdoll breed in 
                        America during the early 1960s, a breeding pair of 
                        Ragdolls was exported to the UK. Eight more cats 
                        followed this pair to fully establish the breed in the 
                        UK, where the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy 
                        recognizes it.

                    <h1>Appearance</h1>
                    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Ragdoll is one of the largest domesticated cat 
                        breeds. Fully-grown females weigh from 8 to 15 pounds 
                        (3.6 to 6.8 kg). Males are substantially larger, 
                        ranging from 12 to 20 pounds (5.4 to 9.1 kg) or more.
                        It can take up to four years for a Ragdoll to reach 
                        mature size.[8] They have a sturdy body, bulky frame, 
                        and proportionate legs. Their heads are broad with a 
                        flat top and wide space between the ears. They have 
                        long, muscular bodies with broad chests and short 
                        necks. Their tails are bushy and long in length, their 
                        paws are large, round, and tufted, and their coats are 
                        silky, dense, and medium to long length. Due to their 
                        coats tending to be long, they usually require brushing 
                        at least twice a week. Adults develop 
                        knickerbockers on their hind legs and a ruff around 
                        their necks   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        he breed is often known for its large, round, deep-blue 
                        eyes,though other cats may have that feature as well. 
                        The genes for point coloration are also responsible for 
                        these distinctive blue eyes. Deeper shades of blue are 
                        favored in cat shows.

                    <p>
                        Although the breed has a plush coat, it consists mainly 
                        of long guard hairs, while the lack of a dense 
                        undercoat results, according to the Cat Fanciers' 
                        Association, in "reduced shedding and matting".
                        There may be a noticeable increase of shedding in the 
                        spring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ragdolls come in six distinct colors: seal, chocolate, 
                        red, and the corresponding dilutes: blue, lilac, and 
                        cream. There also are the lynx and tortoiseshell 
                        variations in all colors and the three patterns. 
                        Ragdoll kittens are born white; they have good color 
                        at 8–10 weeks and full color and coat at 3–4 years. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Patterns</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Colorpoint: one color darkening at the extremities 
                            (nose, ears, tail, and paws) 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mitted: same as pointed but with white paws and 
                            abdomen. With or without a blaze (a white line or 
                            spot on the face), they must have a belly stripe 
                            (white stripe that runs from the chin to the 
                            genitals) and a white chin. Mitted Ragdolls, 
                            which weren't allowed titling in CFA until the 
                            2008–2009 show season, are often confused with 
                            Birmans. The easiest way to tell the difference 
                            is by size (the Ragdoll being larger) and chin 
                            color (Mitted Ragdolls have white chins, while 
                            Birmans have colored chins), although breeders 
                            recognize the two by head shape and boning. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bicolor: white legs, white inverted V on the face, 
                            white abdomen, and sometimes white patches on the 
                            back (excessive amounts of white, or high white, 
                            on a bicolor are known as the Van pattern, although 
                            this does not occur as often as the other patterns). 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> Variations </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Lynx: a variant of the colorpoint type having tabby 
                            markings.[30] This variation always comes with 
                            white ear lines, no matter the pattern.  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tortoiseshell or tortie: a variant noted for 
                            mottled or parti-colored markings in the above 
                            patterns. Despite the mostly white coat, tortie 
                            points are not calico, as the calico gene is 
                            separate and not present in colorpoints
                        </li>

                        he Ragdoll has been known to have a very floppy and 
                        calm nature, with claims that these characteristics 
                        have been passed down from the Persian and Birman 
                        breeds. Opinions vary as to whether this trait might 
                        be the result of genetic mutation or merely an 
                        instinctive reaction from being picked up as kittens 
                        by their mother.The extreme docility of 
                        some individuals has led to the myth that Ragdolls are 
                        pain resistant. Some breeders in Britain have tried to 
                        breed away from the limpness owing to concerns that 
                        extreme docility "might not be in the best interests of 
                        the cat".

                    <p>
                        Breed standard marketing and publicity material 
                        describe the Ragdoll as affectionate, intelligent, 
                        relaxed in temperament, gentle, and an easy-to-handle 
                        lap cat. The animals are often known as "puppy 
                        cats", "dog-like cats", "cat-dogs", etc., because of 
                        their placid nature and affectionate behavior, with the 
                        cats often following owners from room to room as well 
                        as seeking physical affection akin to certain dog 
                        breeds. Ragdolls can be trained to retrieve toys and 
                        enjoy doing so. They have a very playful nature that 
                        often lasts well into their senior years. Unlike 
                        many other breeds, Ragdolls prefer staying low to the 
                        ground rather than the highest point in the household.

                        A UK study utilizing veterinary records found a life 
                        expectancy of 10.31 years compared to 11.74 overall. 
                        One study, utilizing Swedish insurance data, showed 
                        that of the common cat breeds, the Ragdoll and Siamese 
                        have the lowest survival rate, with a 78% chance of 
                        survival to 10 years. An English study of patient 
                        records found a life expectancy of 10.1 years. In a 
                        review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis, the 
                        Ragdoll was over-represented, with an odds ratio of 
                        5.14. An English study reviewing over 190,000 patient 
                        records found the Ragdoll to be less likely to acquire 
                        diabetes mellitus than mixed breed cats. The prevalence 
                        in Ragdolls was 0.24% compared to 0.58% overall.

                    <h3>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Ragdoll is one of the more commonly affected breeds 
                        for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An autosomal dominant 
                        mutation of the MYBPC group of genes is responsible for 
                        the condition in the breed.

                        The allelic frequencies of the mutation R820W were 0.17 
                        in cats from Italy and 0.23 in cats from the US in 2013.
                        This reference states that the R820W prevalence is 30% 
                        in the UK. The HCM prevalence was found to be 2.9% 
                        (95% CI = 2.7–8.6%) in this study.
